"""feed-remove: archive a waelsocial feed entry and then delete it.

This runs on CT 102 as `claude`, which is the only database writer. The console,
running as wsdash, can invoke it only through its sudoers line, using argv arrays
rather than a shell, and wsdash holds no database write grants of its own.

Removal does not destroy the entry. The full row, including its signature, is
copied into `entries_removed` in the same transaction that deletes it from
`entries`. The archive is append-only as a matter of grants: the claude role has
INSERT and SELECT on entries_removed and no UPDATE or DELETE, so not even this
tool can un-archive or purge history. The frozen /srv/waelsocial/feed.json
backup is never touched.
